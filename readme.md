# Legacy Google Calendar Events 2.4 WordPress Plugin

Fork of the Google Calendar Events 2.4 WordPress plugin. Intended for backwards compatibility only.

Disconnected from "Simple Calendar" (formerly Google Calendar Events) on WordPress.org to provide only critical security patches.

All new features added to Simple Calendar going forward.
