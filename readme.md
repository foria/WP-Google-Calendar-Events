# Google Calendar Events for WordPress

Fork of the Google Calendar Events 2.4 WordPress plugin. Intended for backwards compatibility only.

Now maintained on GitHub disconnected from "Simple Calendar" on WordPress.org to provide only critical security patches.

All new features added to Simple Calendar going forward.
